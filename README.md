# Android app with Kotlin and Data Bindings highlighting bug

This is simple app that use Kotlin and DataBindings.
App builds without errors and works as expected, 
but Android Studio shows [strange error](screen1.png) when you try to [set model](screen2.png) to data binding
But if you set simple variable type ([like String](screen3.png)) everything works well
